Hello, welcome to my empty repository!

#Git Assignment - <emily-horrocks>

a. What is an issue?
It is a feature on GitHub that allows us to track requested changes and features in a software project. 

b. What is a pull request?
A pull request will notify the development team that proposed changes have been made to a branch in a repository. They can then be reviewed and merged into the brain branch. 

c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?
First you create a branch. After that, you make changes and commit them. Then you navigate to the Repository on GitHub and click an option to Compare & Pull Request for your branch. You then fill out the pull request form and click the Create pull request button

d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)
In settings on the top of the repoistory page, click Manage access. Click the invite a collaborator button and enter their username or email. Click Add a collaborator and the person invited will receive an email about the invitation and grant them access.

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git allows you to track changes in your code during development. It manages product history and helps with collaboration when coding with others
GitHub hosts Git repositories. It acts as a remote repository to push your Git commits to and pull changes from. 

f. What does git diff do?
Git diff will highlight the added, changes or delete lines of code between commits which is useful when reviewing changes

g. What is the main branch?
This is the default branch in a Git repository where all pull requests would be eventually merged in and would be where the final product is deployed from. 

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
No, instead it is recommended to push your changes to a eperate branch and use a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch
